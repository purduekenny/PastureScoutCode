            <h1>Why is PastureScout needed?</h1>
            <p>There is growing demand for leased pasture and harvested forage resources.

            <p>Widespread drought and increasing costs of ranching are powerful forces driving many producers to find leased pasture and/or harvested forages for feeding in order to avoid selling livestock.</p>

            <h2>Leasing pasture and finding alternative forage sources is harder than it should be.</h2>

            <p>In the past, finding pasture for lease or harvested forage for sale has been difficult and time-consuming.</p>

            <p>For a pasture/forage seeker, information about availability and price is hard to come by, especially if you have to search outside your home region or if you do not regularly lease land or purchase harvested forage. Forage owner, advertising in local newspapers or by word of mouth does not expose you to all eligible lessees or buyers, decreasing your opportunity to get the optimum price and leasing arrangement.
            
            <p>For a pasture/f PastureScout changes this, making finding and securing a pasture lease or forage simple.</p>           

            <h2>Land stewardship is more important than ever.</h2>

            <p>Sustainable land management takes creativity, hard work, and a network of like-minded forage owners and producers. As increasing pressure is put on our nation’s agricultural land, the wise utilization of range, cropland, and harvested forage by capable people is more important than ever.</p>
