            <h1>Why is PastureScout needed?</h1>

                <h2>There is growing demand for leased pasture</h2>
                    <p>Widespread drought and increasing costs of ranch ownership are powerful forces driving many ranchers to find leased pasture in order to avoid selling livestock.</p>  

                <h2>Leasing pasture is harder than it should be</h2>
                    <p>In the past, finding pasture for lease has been difficult and time-consuming.</p>  

                    <p>For a pasture seeker, information about availability and price is hard to come by, especially if you have to search outside your home region or if you do not regularly lease land.</p>  

                    <p>For a pasture owner, advertising in local newspapers or by word of mouth does not expose you to all eligible leases, decreasing your opportunity to get the optimum price and leasing arrangement.</p>   

                    <p>PastureScout changes this, making finding and securing a pasture lease simple.</p>

                <h2>Land stewardship is more important than ever</h2>
                    <p>Sustainable land management takes creativity, hard work, and a network of like-minded landowners and producers.  As increasing pressure is put on our nation’s agricultural land, the wise utilization of range and cropland by capable people is more important than ever.</p>
